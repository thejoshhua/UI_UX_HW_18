  <h1>My skills SUPERPOWERS.</h1>
    <p>As a dynamic, quick thinking indivual who adapts to everything. I have superpowers that stand out more than others... 
  Curiosity.  Something that is always moving in my head. Always asking myself questions. How can this product make their lives better? What are there motiviations?
  Empathy.  Putting myself in the user’s shoes and undersdtanding their pain points is key to creating a resoultion for the problem. Gathering facts through observation and interviews rather than making assumptions or being bias.
  Communication . Something that will always be done on a daily basis as a designer. If its talking with other designers, customers, marketing teams, and even stake holders. Communications is essential. Having the skill to communicate and present is needed.
  Flexibility.  PUTTING ASIDE MY ego and assumptions and be willing to listen to what the research tells them. Adapting to changes and capable to deal with ambiguous, undefined problems.</p>
